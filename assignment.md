**Document Status:** Case Study Submission

## Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for Freecash.com's new login flow implementation. As an experienced QA engineer who has worked on multiple authentication systems, I've structured this plan to ensure comprehensive coverage of all critical paths while maintaining efficient use of resources.

## 1. Test Objectives

Primary objectives for this testing effort:

- Validate the new login flow across all platforms (web, iOS, Android)
- Ensure seamless integration of multiple authentication methods:
  - Email/password login
  - Third-party authentication (Google, Facebook, Steam)
- Verify CAPTCHA implementation for failed login attempts
- Confirm consistent behavior across all platforms
- Validate security measures and data protection

Success will be measured by:

- Complete functional coverage of all login paths
- Verified security of authentication processes
- Consistent user experience across platforms
- Proper CAPTCHA triggering after 3 failed attempts

## 2. Scope of Testing

### In Scope

#### User Interface

- Desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile web browsers
- Native iOS app
- Native Android app
- Responsive design validation

#### Functionality

- Email/password authentication
- Third-party authentication flows
- CAPTCHA implementation
- Session management
- Cross-platform consistency

#### Backend

- Authentication API endpoints
- Third-party integration points
- CAPTCHA service integration
- Session handling

### Out of Scope

- User registration flow (existing functionality)
- Password reset functionality
- Account deletion process
- User profile management

## 3. Resources Required

### Team Structure

- 1 QA Lead (myself)
- 1 QA Engineers (web/mobile testing)

### Tools

- Test Management: JIRA + TestRail
- Automation: Playwright + Typescript
- API Testing: Postman
- Security: OWASP ZAP
- Devices:
  - iOS test devices (17+)
  - Android test devices (14+)
  - Laptop for web testing

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Functional Testing

#### Email/Password Login

- **Positive Cases:**

  - Valid email/password combination
  - Case sensitivity validation
  - Special characters in password
  - Remember me functionality

- **Negative Cases:**
  - Invalid email format
  - Wrong password
  - Empty fields

#### Third-party Authentication

- **Positive Cases:**

  - Successful Google login
  - Successful Facebook login
  - Account linking verification

- **Negative Cases:**
  - Cancelled authentication
  - Network timeout
  - Invalid/expired tokens
  - Account mismatch scenarios

### Phase 2: Platform-Specific Testing

- Desktop browser compatibility
- Mobile browser compatibility
- iOS native app functionality
- Android native app functionality
- Cross-platform consistency

### Phase 3: Security Testing

- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS vulnerability checks
- Session management
- Token handling
- Rate limiting verification

## 5. Test Schedule

### Week 1

- Days 1-2: Test planning and environment setup
- Days 3-4: Core functionality testing (email/password)
- Days 4-5: Third-party authentication testing

### Week 2

- Days 1-3: Cross-platform testing
- Days 4-5: Security testing and documentation

## 6. Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

1. **Third-party Authentication Availability**

   - _Risk:_ External providers may be unavailable during testing
   - _Mitigation:_ Create test accounts for all providers, prepare mock responses

2. **Cross-platform Consistency**

   - _Risk:_ Different behavior across platforms
   - _Mitigation:_ Maintain detailed test matrix, test on actual devices

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - _Risk:_ Potential security gaps in authentication flow
   - _Mitigation:_ Involve security QA specialist, follow OWASP testing guidelines

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **CAPTCHA Implementation**

   - _Risk:_ False positives/negatives in CAPTCHA triggering
   - _Mitigation:_ Extensive edge case testing, clear verification steps

2. **Mobile Platform Fragmentation**
   - _Risk:_ Inconsistent behavior across different mobile versions
   - _Mitigation:_ Test on most common device/OS combinations

## Additional Considerations

From my experience testing authentication systems, I recommend:

1. **Test Account Management**

   - Maintain separate test accounts for each authentication method
   - Create accounts with various states (new, active, locked)
   - Document all test account credentials securely

2. **Environment Setup**

   - Ensure test environment mirrors production settings
   - Configure all third-party integrations
   - Set up monitoring for authentication attempts

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Start with core email/password testing
   - Progress to third-party authentication
   - Focus on cross-platform consistency
   - End with security validation
